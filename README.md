## A tutorial for learning object-oriented javascript

In his excellent book, [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), [Marijn Haverbeke](https://twitter.com/marijnjh) creates an ecosystem simulation to demonstrate the foundational concepts of object-oriented javascript.

The code in this repo breaks this tutorial down into steps that are separated out into branches.
